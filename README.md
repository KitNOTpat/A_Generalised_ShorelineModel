## Description

This interactive tool presents the outputs of a generalised shoreline forecasting model developed using satellite-derived shoreline and wave data across the New South Wales coastline.

The model, trained on over **7,000 transects**, demonstrates the potential of machine learning to provide **scalable**, long-term coastal change predictions **without site-specific calibration**.

## Features

- Interactive Folium map of the NSW coast
- Over 8,000 transects with click-enabled popups
- Each popup shows:
  - Predicted shoreline position
  - Uncertainty bounds
  - Historical observations
- Powered by:
  - Folium (Python)
  - Chart.js (JavaScript)
  - JSON-based prediction delivery

## How to Use

1. Open `interactive_map.html` or visit the GitHub Pages site (if deployed).
2. Zoom and pan along the coastline.
3. Click on a transect to view model predictions and ground-truth data.
